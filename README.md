EduKC - Equal opportunity beyond classroom - Hack-a-Roo - Team Roodents

This is a submission for Hack-a-Roo hackathon by UDICA at UMKC.

Our app helps parents and kids to  better  choose  and  plan  education  resources  outside  of  public-school  systems.  This  app  will look  like  a  trip  planner:  the  user  provides budget, time, locations, the kidsâ€™ gender, age, and interest. The app can make recommendations on afterschool programs, particularly affordable or free programs to lower income families. 

The family can use this app to choose available and affordable after school programs andmake their weekly or monthly schedule.
