For any parent looking for a place for their kids to learn, know these three things: 1) they care about the kids and their safety; 2) your child will learn a lot; and 3) they promote a very positive atmosphere where not just the instructors are encouraging but the kids are encouraging.  For the beginner, they will hold their hands until they feel they are ready to go. Even then, they will be right there to catch them.'
